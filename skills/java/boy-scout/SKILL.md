  Also trigger on: "while you're at it", "any quick wins", "improve this a bit", "anything else obviously wrong", or when editing existing Java and an adjacent small cleanup is possible alongside the asked-for change.

# The Boy Scout Rule

> "Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it."
> — Robert Baden-Powell

> "Always check a module in cleaner than when you checked it out."
> — Robert C. Martin, _Clean Code_

## The Philosophy

You don't have to make every module perfect. You simply have to make it **a little bit better** than when you found it.

If we all followed this simple rule:

- Our systems would gradually get better as they evolved
- Teams would care for the system as a whole
- The relentless deterioration of software would end

## When Working on Code

Every time you touch code, look for **at least one small improvement**:

### Quick Wins (Do These Immediately)

- Rename a poorly named variable → triggers `clean-names`
- Delete a redundant comment → triggers `clean-comments`
- Remove dead code or unused imports
- Replace a magic number with a named constant
- Extract a deeply nested block into a well-named method

### Deeper Improvements (When Time Allows)

- Split a method that does multiple things → triggers `clean-functions`
- Remove duplication (DRY) → triggers `clean-general`
- Add missing boundary checks
- Improve test coverage → triggers `clean-tests`

## The Rule in Practice

```java
// You're asked to fix a bug in this method:
List<Double> proc(List<Double> d, List<Double> x, boolean flag) {
    // process data
    for (double i : d) {
        if (i > 0) {
            if (flag) {
                x.add(i * 1.0825);  // tax
            } else {
                x.add(i);
            }
        }
    }
    return x;
}

// Don't just fix the bug and leave.
// Leave it cleaner:
static final double TAX_RATE = 0.0825;

/** Filter positive values, optionally applying tax. */
List<Double> processPositiveValues(List<Double> values, boolean applyTax) {
    double rate = applyTax ? 1 + TAX_RATE : 1;
    return values.stream()
        .filter(v -> v > 0)
        .map(v -> v * rate)
        .toList();
}
```

**What changed:**

- ✅ Descriptive method name (N1)
- ✅ Clear parameter names (N1)
- ✅ Explicit type declarations
- ✅ Named constant for magic number (G25)
- ✅ No output argument mutation (F2)
- ✅ Useful Javadoc (C4)

## Skill Orchestration

This skill coordinates with specialized skills based on what you're doing:

| Task                               | Trigger Skill              |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Writing/reviewing any Java         | `java-clean-code` (master) |
| Naming variables, methods, classes | `clean-names`              |
| Writing or editing comments        | `clean-comments`           |
| Creating or refactoring methods    | `clean-functions`          |
| Reviewing code quality             | `clean-general`            |
| Writing or reviewing tests         | `clean-tests`              |

## The Mindset

**Don't:**

- Leave code worse than you found it
- Say "that's not my code"
- Wait for a dedicated refactoring sprint
- Make massive changes unrelated to your task

**Do:**

- Make one small improvement with every commit
- Fix what you see, even if you didn't break it
- Keep changes proportional to your task
- Leave a trail of quality improvements

## AI Behavior

When working on code:

1. Complete the requested task first
2. Identify at least one small cleanup opportunity
3. Apply the appropriate specialized skill
4. Note the improvement made (e.g., "Also cleaned up: renamed `x` to `results` for clarity")

When reviewing code:

1. Load `java-clean-code` for comprehensive rule checking
2. Flag violations by rule number
3. Suggest incremental improvements, not complete rewrites

## The Boy Scout Promise

Every piece of code you touch gets a little better. Not perfect—just better.

Over time, better compounds into excellent.
